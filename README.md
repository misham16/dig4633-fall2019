## VR Lab: 1
For this assignment, the player must prepare their chickens for a chicken show by gathering the neccessary items found throughtout the farm. The game acts as an introductory VR game, with the main goal to be letting players explore the farm and interact with objects at their own pace to get a better idea of how VR games feel to play. 

Other assets that were used include the Farm Animals Set by Vertex Cat.

## AR Lab: 2
This lab allows the user to create object in midair that appear in the real world similar to how in the AR game, dARK portals are created in midair. In this lab however, players can interact and tab at the created object (in this case a duck), but in dARK players must hop in and through the portal to progress the game.
